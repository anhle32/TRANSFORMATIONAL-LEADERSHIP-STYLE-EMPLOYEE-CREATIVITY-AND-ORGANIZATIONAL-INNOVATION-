Organizational innovation is one of the important issues for organizations in each country to adapt to the changing operating environment, scientific and technological progress, and crisis issues.

The results show that transformational leadership style and employee creativity positively impact organizational innovation. Besides, this result also implies that employee creativity is a mediating factor in the impact of transformational leadership style on organizational innovation.
